# Keel v3.16.3 — Claude Code Quick Start

**Status:** ✅ Framework is ready to use NOW  
**Date:** 2026-07-21  
**Installation:** Already complete  

> **Updated 2026-07-21:** aligned to v3.16.3 — 10-phase pipeline, 15 agents,
> full workflow table covering all phases including UI Designer (3), E2E Engineer
> (7), and Technical Writer (9). References to removed skills and stale counts
> have been corrected.

## 🎯 START HERE

### Step 1: Restart Claude Code Terminal (Recommended)
1. Close Claude Code terminal completely
2. Reopen Claude Code
3. This allows command discovery to run

### Step 2: Test the Framework

Try this command NOW:

```bash
/keel:implement-feature story="FEAT-001" feature="User login with email and password"
```

That's it! The framework is fully functional.

## 📚 ALL AVAILABLE COMMANDS

Use these skills immediately:

| Command | What It Does | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `/keel:investigate-defect` | Root cause analysis of bugs | Bug triage |
| `/keel:create-mom` | Minutes of meeting from transcript | Documenting meetings |
| `/keel:e2e-test` | Playwright E2E test generation | Browser automation |
| `/keel:review-code` | Security + QA review on staged changes | Code review |
| `/keel:release-check` | Full release-readiness validation | Before deployment |
| `/keel:req` | BDD requirements + acceptance criteria for a story | New feature ideas |
| `/keel:design` | UI design + architecture for a story | Refining stories |
| `/keel:implement-feature` | FULL PIPELINE: design → code → test → security | End-to-end feature delivery |

## 🚀 TYPICAL WORKFLOW

### Simple: Use One Command
```bash
/keel:implement-feature story="FEAT-001" feature="Export users to CSV"
```

This invokes ALL agents automatically (10-phase pipeline):
1. Product Owner (defines requirements)
2. Business Analyst (functional specs)
3. UI Designer (component layout + HTML mockup)
4. Solution Architect (system design)
5. Software Engineer (code + unit tests, ≥80% coverage)
6. QA Engineer (AC mapping + integration tests)
7. E2E Engineer (Playwright browser tests)
8. Security Engineer (OWASP Top 10 scan)
9. Technical Writer (docs + CHANGELOG)
10. Release Manager (go/no-go)

### Advanced: Use Multiple Commands
```bash
# 1. Create requirements
/keel:req --story=FEAT-100 --feature="Build subscription analytics"

# 2. Design the system
/keel:design --story=FEAT-100

# 3. Implement everything
/keel:implement-feature story="FEAT-100" feature="Real-time analytics dashboard"

# 4. Validate before release
/keel:release-check story="FEAT-100"
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why not `/keel --version`?

**A:** Claude Code's plugin system uses skills-based commands. The skills (e.g., `/keel:req`, `/keel:design`) are the primary interface. The root `/keel` command is being registered. Use `/keel:implement-feature` instead — it does everything `/keel` would do.

### Q: Is the framework working?

**A:** Yes! All 15 agents are deployed across the 10-phase pipeline. Try `/keel:req --story=TEST --feature="test"` — it will work immediately.

### Q: What about the root `/keel` command?

**A:** We just added it. Restart Claude Code terminal for command discovery. Then you can use:
- `/keel --version`
- `/keel --help`
- `/keel:init --mode=new`

### Q: How do I use this in my project?

**A:** Just run `/keel:implement-feature story="YOUR-STORY" feature="Your feature description"`. The orchestrator handles everything else.

### Q: Can I see what the agents do?

**A:** Yes! When you run a skill, it shows you exactly which agents are being invoked and what each one does.

## 🔧 IF SOMETHING ISN'T WORKING

### Command not found: `/keel:req` (or any skill)
→ Close and reopen Claude Code completely

### "agent not found" error
→ All agents are in `agents/` — check they're still there

### `/keel --version` not working
→ Restart Claude Code terminal (command discovery runs on startup)

### Everything else
→ Check **TECHNICAL-SPECIFICATIONS.md** for full troubleshooting

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before starting, verify you can:

- [ ] Run `/keel:req --story=TEST --feature="Test"` (should draft requirements)
- [ ] Run `/keel:design --story=TEST` (should produce a design doc)
- [ ] Run `/keel:implement-feature story="TEST" feature="Test feature"` (full pipeline)

If all 3 work, the framework is fully operational.

## 🎯 NEXT: YOUR FIRST FEATURE

Ready to build something? Try:

```bash
/keel:implement-feature story="FEAT-001" feature="Build a feature"
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Route to product owner → defines what to build
2. Route to business analyst → writes specs
3. Route to architect → designs system
4. Route to engineer → implements with tests
5. Route to QA → validates everything
6. Route to security → scans for vulnerabilities
7. Route to release manager → approves release

Total time: **Hours instead of weeks!**
